# Robocopy GUI (C++/CLI, WinForms)
A graphical interface for Robocopy, the advanced file copy utility built into Windows.
This project aims to make Robocopy more accessible to students, professionals, and everyday users who prefer a visual experience rather than working with the command line.

## Features
- Folder selection for source and destination using a graphical browser.

- Dynamic progress bar (Marquee or continuous depending on the number of files).

- Real‑time logging of Robocopy’s output in a RichTextBox.

- Clear error and completion messages.

- A label explaining the most common flags (/E, /MIR, /COPY:DATSO, etc.), helping users understand what each option does.

## Purpose
The goal is to simplify the use of Robocopy as both an educational and practical resource, demonstrating how a powerful command‑line tool can be integrated into a user‑friendly application.

## Warning! 
This application may become unresponsive when dealing with multiple copies or large files. Please bear this in mind.

## Licence
